# Overview

<!---(Describe the purpose of this document in 1 paragraph of less â€¦ hint: it is your SRS)-->
This document serves as a set of software requirements which make the program both effective and intuitive to use. These requirements were created at the start of the development process to set clear and measurable features which must be created. This document may be updated when appropriate in the development cycle, such as at the start of the next sprint. 

## Functional Requirements

1. Software Feature: GUI
    1. The GUI does not consume more than 1 GB of memory.
    2. The GUI shall be able to load a video file into memory.
