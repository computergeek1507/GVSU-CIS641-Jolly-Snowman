Discussion points:

Discussion of upcoming tasks:
- The only unfinished task at this point is allowing the user to select an area of interest (SH, GE, JM). There is not a lot of interest in continuing this feature development. 
  The team has long since met its original feature goals. At this time we will continue to work on the final deliverables, with the possibility of completing this item afterward.
- The team talked about what other steps were necessary to allow the program to be easily downloadable and used. 
  Scott will look into GitHub actions for creating a downloadable packet. 

Preparing for the Final Presentation & Final Deliverables:
- Jessica completed most of the Change Management Plan. She wanted to add on a more detailed residential use guide. 
  She will also continue to polish the presentation materials before the meeting next week. 
- George added the software artifact links to the SRS final document. 
- Scott has added some requirements, and the team will work together to finish the rest.
