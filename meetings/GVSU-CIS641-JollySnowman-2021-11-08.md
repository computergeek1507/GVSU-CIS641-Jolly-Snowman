Discussion points:

- Discussion of on-going tasks:
    - Unit testing of the image analyzer. This task is still on-going and will require longer than planned time. Due date is moved. More on testing below (GE, JM, DUE 11/15)
    - Look into using tools to reduce CPU utilization, such as OpenMP. Moved from on-going to complete (GE)
    - Control lights with DMX. Moved from on-going to complete (SH, DUE 11/15)
    - Unit testing of the model exporter, on-going (JM, DUE 11/15)
- George shared that he looked into how to use the GPU in a .net application. OpenCV has a built in option for this using the UMat class, which uses the GPU if available.
- Scott shared that he was working through a failed test case. Time was spent working on test cases of the image analyzer. 

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

- Finish unit testing of image analyzer with completed by next Monday. (GE, JM). 
- Scott will start on the 'Add support for RTSP cameras' task
