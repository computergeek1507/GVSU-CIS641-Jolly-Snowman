Discussion points:

- Discussion of on-going tasks:
    - Analyze a live video feed. Moved from on-going to complete. (JM, DUE 11/2)
    - Unit testing of the image analyzer. This task is still on-going and will require longer than planned time. (GE, JM, DUE 11/2)
    - Look into using tools to reduce CPU utilization, such as OpenMP. This is a smaller task that George will continue to work on. (GE, DUE 11/3)
    - Control lights with DMX. Proof of concept is there as Scott was able to remotely control a model. He will continue working to refine this feature. (SH, DUE 11/15)
    - Unit testing of the model exporter (JM, DUE 11/15)
- There is high volume of on-going tasks. Workload between team members was discussed with Jessica increasing her workload to take on a larger volume of tasks. Scott and George feel comfortable with their current workload.
- Another task was added for Jessica to complete in order to have better user experience, 'Add tool tips to settings menu'. This will be completed after testing is complete.
- Everyone felt that the coding session held last week was helpful.  

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

- Finish unit testing of image analyzer with completed by next Monday. (GE, JM). 
- Complete the task of looking into reducing CPU utilization by next Monday (GE). 
- On-going refinement of the DMX light controls feature. (SH).
