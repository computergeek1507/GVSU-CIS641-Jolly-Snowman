Discussion points:
- We started this meeting with a code review and progress check in. Since the demo can serve as a functional base we will move on from isolated projects (demo, alternative library exploration) to working together to fully develop features and proceed with testing. 
- Refinements were made to the slideshow Jessica put together. 
- Tasks were assigned from the Gantt chart that George started. Other tasks were added and assigned as necessary. 

Goals for next week:
- Finish the task of outputting a properly formatted .xModal file (SH, GE, DUE 10/25)
- Start unit testing process of image analyzer (JM, DUE 1/2)
