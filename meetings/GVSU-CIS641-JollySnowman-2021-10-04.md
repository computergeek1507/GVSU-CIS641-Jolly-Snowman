# CIS641 Meeting October 4, 2021

## Meeting minutes

Team name: Jolly Snowman

Members present: Scott Hanson, Jessica Malinowski (George out of town, had communicated this ahead of time)

Date: 10-04-21

Time: 6:00 PM

Discussion points: 

* Sharing of projects completed over the past week (Scott's demo project, Jess' exploratory Mask R-CNN project)
* Summary of sharing of Jess' exploratory Mask R-CNN project: while Mask R-CNN provides a powerful CV engine it is probably unnecessary for this project and creates a higher level of complexity. 
* Summary of sharing of Scott's demo: Scott has created a video file reader with scrubbing capabilities to process individual frames. Processing individual frames highlights features of interest effectively in the demo video file. 
* Future engineering roadblocks were discussed, including the difficulty of scale used in the xLights program. 

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Scott will add an image upload feature to his Demo. 
* Jessica will refine the current model based off the demo base. 
* George will start to prepare midterm presentation materials.
