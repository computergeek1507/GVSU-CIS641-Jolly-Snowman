# Jolly Snowman

<!---Project description (~1 paragraph)-->
High-end Christmas light shows involve the complex management and control of addressable LEDs. Synchronizing the LEDs to display simple and complex patterns requires modeling each object (tree, reindeer, arches, etc.) in the display. Specifically, these models contain the coordinate information for every LED on the object. Current methods for creating these models involve the time-consuming task of manually creating and adding each LED to the model and then verifying the model's accuracy.

The goal of this project was to develop an application that can automate the task of creating these models. Through a video or live stream, each LED is turned on and off in sequence. The information is stored and then used to export a .xmodel file for use with XLights.

## Installation Guide

## Running Jolly Snowman

We recommend the Jolly Snowman software for residential use with users who are already moderately familiar with xLights. Users who are novices with xLights may want to focus on learning that software program first before utilizing Jolly Snowman. 

Jolly Snowman can be utilized with video files or a live stream. Listed below are the ideal video conditions. While it is possible to process a video that is less than ideal you may find the video processing more challenging, and it may require more fine tuning of the video settings. 

As a reminder a quality video file or live stream will:
- Have all of the lights visible in the frame. 
- Background and ambient lighting is as dark as possible, so that when a light turns on it is the only bring object in the frame. 
- Be as still and steady as possible, with lights in focus as they illuminate. A video recorded from a stand or other stationary object is best.
- Each light should illuminate one at a time, and not more than once per light. 
- We recommend illuminating the lights white for the purposes of this video.
